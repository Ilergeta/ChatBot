This website uses a machine learning model to generate trade policies based on
previous ITC policies official documents made for similar trade issues detected.

__Description__:


This project uses a USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) published by Google at [TensorFlow
Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) and it is based on a DAN (Deep Averaging Network) architecture. Once new input text
is encoded it is compared (with [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) ) to previous ITC policies and
model outputs more similar activities proposed for those issues.

Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:

text_long = """
__ITC ML similarity model__:
_This website is for entertainment purposes only!_
This website uses a machine learning model to generate trade policies based on
previous ITC policies official documents made for similar trade issues detected.

__Description__:
This project uses a USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) published by Google at TensorFlow
Hub and it is based on a DAN (Deep Averaging Network) architecture. Once new input text
is encoded it is compared (with cosinus similarity) to previous ITC policies and
model outputs more similar activities proposed for those issues.
